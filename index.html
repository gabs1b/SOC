Musk is a genius and will go down as one of the greatest engineers the world has ever seen. He is pushing the boundaries of science and technology with his ambitions in electric power and space. Like a true engineer, he has developed solutions for the problems of modern civilization. He has plans to solve our traffic problems with autonomous cars and tunnel networks. Perhaps more remarkable, he has plans to eliminate most of our fossil fuel dependence and switch to cleaner and more sustainable sources of energy."
